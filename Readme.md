# Six Advantages of Cloud Computing
* Trade capital expenses for variable expense
* Benefit from massive economics of scale
* Stop guessing about capacity
* Increase speed and agility
* Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers.
* Go global in minutes

# Cloud Computing Models
## Infrastructure as Service(__IasS__)
* Provide access to network features, computers and data storage space.
* Highest level of flexibility and management control

## Platform as Service(__PasS__)
* Removes the need to manage the underlying infrastructure
* Focus on the deployment and management of your application

## Software as a Service(__SaaS__)
* Provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider.
* You do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the  underlying infrastructure is managed;you only need to think about how you will use that particular piece of software.
* ex: web-based email , payment service
